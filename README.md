Instructions (P1)
For each dataset, we provide the training dataset, training label, and test dataset. Please use the training dataset and training label to build your classifier and predict the test label.

Instructions (P2)
The first task of the course project is to estimate missing value in the Microarray Data. Please fill those missing entries with estimated values and return the complete dataset to me.


- There are two places (for each file) where you need to copy the respective file path and paste it.
	- TDx =  (x being a replacement for the dataset number)
	- TDx_labels =  (x being a replacement for the dataset number)
	- TestingDx =  (x being a replacement for the dataset number)
    - Run

For Datasets 3 and 5
	- Running certain parts of the code will take too long, so you can interrupt the cell that's taking too long and continue on with the next cell.

Running Part 2 Code:
- Copy the location/path of the respective file and paste it in the file path variable.
- Run
